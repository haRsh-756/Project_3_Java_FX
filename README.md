Students enrolled more than 16 credit hours will pay additional for the credit hours exceed 16, using the same per
credit hour rate as the parttime students. Students enrolled at least 12 credits are considered as full time, otherwise

students must enroll at least 12 credits, except for the international students who are participating in the study abroad
program. The maximum number of credits enrolled for the international students in the study abroad program is 12.
Students may have different tuition remissions as listed below. However, parttime students DO NOT qualify.
- Resident students are eligible for scholarship with a maximum amount of $10,000.
- Non-resident students from the tristate area get the tuition discount: $4,000 for New York state residents, and
$5,000 for Connecticut residents.
- International students participating in the study abroad program do not pay the tuition. They pay the fees only.
- Here are some tuition calculation examples.
- Resident students with 18 credit hours: 12,536 + 3,268 + 404 * (18 – 16) = $16,612
- Resident students with 18 credit hours and $10,000 scholarship: 12,536 + 3,268 + 404 * (18 – 16) – 10,000 = $6,612
- Non-resident students with 12 credit hours: 29,737 + 3,268 = $33,005
- Tristate student with 9 credits: 966 * 9 + 3,268 * 80% = $11,308.40
- International student with 12 credits: 29,737 + 3,268 + 2,650 = $35,655
- International student in study abroad program with 12 credits: 3,268 + 2,650 = $5,918
